# Parsec Autobuilder

Given that the original scripts which spawned parsec are now used across a
number of different places ([parsec](https://github.com/galaxy-iuc/parsec),
[arrow](https://github.com/galaxy-genome-annotation/python-apollo/), and
[chakin](https://github.com/abretaud/python-chado)), this tooling was extracted
to make keeping those in-sync an easier process.
